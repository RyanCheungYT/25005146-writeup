One of the most important lessons I’ve learned from this exercise is how to prompt the AI effectively. Providing clear instructions and relevant examples is essential to help it understand my intent.
Using AI for vibe coding introduces several challenges. I need to understand what changes the AI makes, identify any bugs that arise, and guide it with providing feedback. If I don’t explain things clearly, the AI tends to repeat the same errors, which leads to a frustrating cycle of debugging.

As the code becomes more complex, the chances of bugs increase. Often, I struggle to understand the changes made by the AI, and it takes extra time to review and verify whether those changes are correct. This uncertainty can lead to more bugs, requiring repeated debugging sessions with the AI.

Deploying to Vercel adds another layer of complexity. Certain parts of the code must be verified and adjusted to ensure successful deployment. I spend most of time to troubleshoot the deployment issues. When I ask the AI for help, it has to reprocess the entire conversation and codebase each time, which slows down the workflow and makes the process more time-consuming.
